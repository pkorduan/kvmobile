# Cordova/PhoneGap sqlite storage - premium enterprise version with legacy support for memory improvements, ATTACH/DETACH (Android/iOS/macOS), and TBD other extra features
 
Native interface to sqlite in a Cordova/PhoneGap plugin for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows 10 UWP (Universal Windows Platform), with API similar to HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).

This plugin version is available under GPL v3 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt) or a premium commercial license.

NOTE: Commercial licenses for Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free purchased before July 2016 are valid for this plugin version. Commercial licenses for Cordova-sqlite-evcore versions are NOT valid for this plugin version.

## About this plugin version branch

This plugin version branch includes ATTACH/DETACH support for Android/iOS/macOS, some memory usage improvements for Android/iOS/macOS, and TBD other extra features.

NOTE: This version branch has some additional known [issues fixed in newer version branches](#issues-fixed-in-newer-version-branches).

<!-- FUTURE TBD other version-specific bug notices -->

<!-- END About this plugin version branch -->

## WARNING: Multiple SQLite problem on Android

This plugin uses a non-standard [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) implementation on Android. In case an application access the **same** database using multiple plugins there is a risk of data corruption ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#626](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/626)) as described in <http://ericsink.com/entries/multiple_sqlite_problem.html> and <https://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html>.

The workaround is to use the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` setting as described in the **Android sqlite implementation** section below:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", androidDatabaseImplementation: 2});
```

<!-- END WARNING: Multiple SQLite problem on Android -->

## IMPORTANT: iCloud backup of SQLite database is NOT allowed

As documented in the "**A User’s iCloud Storage Is Limited**" section of [iCloudFundamentals in Mac Developer Library iCloud Design Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/iCloudFundametals.html) (near the beginning):

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>DO</b> store the following in iCloud:
  <ul>
   <li>[<i>other items omitted</i>]</li>
   <li>Change log files for a SQLite database (a SQLite database’s store file must never be stored in iCloud)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>DO NOT</b> store the following in iCloud:
  <ul>
   <li>[<i>items omitted</i>]</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
- <cite><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/iCloudFundametals.html">iCloudFundamentals in Mac Developer Library iCloud Design Guide</a>
</blockquote>

### How to disable iCloud backup

**Already fixed in this version:** ~~Use the `location` option in `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` to store the database in a subdirectory that is *NOT* backed up to iCloud, as described in the section below.~~

**NOTE:** Changing `BackupWebStorage` in `config.xml` has no effect on a database created by this plugin. `BackupWebStorage` applies only to local storage and/or Web SQL storage created in the WebView (*not* using this plugin). For reference: [phonegap/build#338 (comment)](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/338#issuecomment-113328140)

## Status

- A recent version of the Cordova CLI (such as `6.5.0` / `7.1.0`) is recommended. (Cordova CLI 8.x includes `cordova-android@7`, NOT supported by this plugin version due to [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#729](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/729).) Cordova versions older than `6.0.0` are missing the `cordova-ios@4.0.0` security fixes. In addition it may be necessary to use `cordova prepare` in case of cordova-ios older than `4.3.0` (Cordova CLI `6.4.0`).
- This plugin is NOT supported by PhoneGap Developer App or PhoneGap Desktop App.
- Default location for iOS is `Library/LocalDatabase`, will *not* be backed up to iCloud (may **not** be changed in this version)
- This plugin version will NOT work on `cordova-android@7` due to issue with JAR and NDK library files as discussed in [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#729](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/729).
- Free support is available in [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free / issues](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free/issues); premium commercial support is available by contacting: <sales@litehelpers.net>
- Patches patches will *NOT* be accepted on this project due to potential licensing issues.
- SQLite `3.8.10.2` included in this plugin version, with the following definitions:
  - `NDEBUG` on Windows (Release build only)
  - `SQLITE_THREADSAFE=1` (`SQLITE_THREADSAFE=2` on Android)
  - `SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS=0` (iOS/macOS/Windows)
  - ~~`SQLITE_OMIT_DECLTYPE`~~ (TBD issue with this option on sqlite 3.8.10.2)
  - `SQLITE_OMIT_DEPRECATED` (iOS/macOS/Windows)
  - `SQLITE_OMIT_PROGRESS_CALLBACK` (iOS/macOS/Windows)
  - `SQLITE_OMIT_SHARED_CACHE` (iOS/macOS/Windows)
  - `SQLITE_TEMP_STORE=2`
  - `SQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION` (iOS/macOS/Windows)
  - `SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3`
  - `SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS`
  - `SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS4`
  - `SQLITE_ENABLE_RTREE`
  - `SQLITE_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=1024` and `SQLITE_DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE=2000` to avoid "potentially distruptive change(s)" from SQLite 3.12.0 described at: <http://sqlite.org/pgszchng2016.html>
  - `SQLITE_OS_WINRT` (Windows only)
  - `NDEBUG` (Windows only)
- This plugin version supports the use of two (2) possible Android sqlite database implementations:
  - default: lightweight [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector)
  - optional: built-in Android database classes (usage described below)
- Windows platform version (using a customized version of the performant [doo / SQLite3-WinRT](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT) C++ component) has the following known limitations:
  - This version branch has dependency on `v140` build toolset included by Visual Studio 2015 ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#580](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/580) (UNTESTED and UNSUPPORTED WORKAROUND for Visual Studio 2017 is described at: <https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/48806/cant-find-v140-in-visual-studio-2017.html>)
  - It is **not** possible to use this plugin with the default "Any CPU" target. A specific target CPU type **must** be specified when building an app with this plugin.
  - Truncation issue with UNICODE `\u0000` character (same as `\0`)
  - No background processing
  - NONCOMPLIANT error code (-1) and INCONSISTENT error message (missing actual error info) in error callbacks ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#539](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/539)
  - Not possible to read BLOB column values
  - Windows platform version uses `UTF-16le` internal database encoding while the other platform versions use `UTF-8` internal encoding. (`UTF-8` internal encoding is preferred ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#652](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/652))
- The macOS platform version ("osx" platform) is not tested in a release build and should be considered pre-alpha.
- Android versions supported: 2.3.3 - 7.1.1 (API level 10 - 25), depending on Cordova version ref: <https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/>
- iOS versions supported: 8.x / 9.x / 10.x / 11.x
- FTS3, FTS4, and R-Tree are fully tested and supported for all target platforms in this version branch.
- Default `PRAGMA journal_mode` setting (*tested*):
  - Android pre-8.0 with builtin android.database implementation (as selected using the `androidDatabaseImplementation` option in `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase`): `persist`
  - otherwise: `delete`
- AUTO-VACUUM is not enabled by default. If no form of `VACUUM` or `PRAGMA auto_vacuum` is used then sqlite will automatically reuse deleted data space for new data but the database file will never shrink. For reference: <http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum> and [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#646](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/646)

## Highlights

- Drop-in replacement for HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/): the only change should be to replace the static `window.openDatabase()` factory call with `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`, with parameters as documented below.
- Failure-safe nested transactions with batch processing optimizations (according to HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/))
- Transaction API (based on HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/)) is designed for maximum flexiblibility, does not allow any transactions to be left hanging open.
- Pre-populated openDatabase option (usage described below)
- As described in [this posting](http://brodyspark.blogspot.com/2012/12/cordovaphonegap-sqlite-plugins-offer.html):
  - Keeps sqlite database in known, platform specific user data location on all supported platforms (Android/iOS/macOS/Windows), which can be reconfigured on iOS/macOS. Whether or not the database on the iOS platform is synchronized to iCloud depends on the selected database location.
  - No arbitrary size limit. SQLite limits described at: <http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html>
- Also validated for multi-page applications by internal test selfTest function.
- This project is self-contained though with sqlite3 dependencies auto-fetched by npm. There are no dependencies on other plugins such as cordova-plugin-file.
- Windows platform version uses a customized version of the performant [doo / SQLite3-WinRT](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT) C++ component.
- [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) support for Android/iOS/macOS/Windows is available in: [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter)
- Intellectual property:
  - All source code is tracked to the original author in git
  - Major authors are tracked in AUTHORS.md
  - License of each component is tracked in LICENSE.md
  - History of this project is also described in HISTORY.md

**TIP:** It is possible to migrate from Cordova to a pure native solution and continue using the data stored by this plugin.

## Security

### Security of sensitive data

According to [Web SQL Database API 7.2 Sensitivity of data](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#sensitivity-of-data):
>User agents should treat persistently stored data as potentially sensitive; it's quite possible for e-mails, calendar appointments, health records, or other confidential documents to be stored in this mechanism.
>
>To this end, user agents should ensure that when deleting data, it is promptly deleted from the underlying storage.

Unfortunately this plugin will not actually overwrite the deleted content unless the [secure_delete PRAGMA](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_secure_delete) is used.

### SQL injection

As "strongly recommended" by [Web SQL Database API 8.5 SQL injection](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#sql-injection):
>Authors are strongly recommended to make use of the `?` placeholder feature of the `executeSql()` method, and to never construct SQL statements on the fly.

<!-- END Security -->

# Avoiding data loss

- Double-check that the application code follows the documented API for SQL statements, parameter values, success callbacks, and error callbacks.
- For standard Web SQL transactions include a transaction error callback with the proper logic that indicates to the user if data cannot be stored for any reason. In case of individual SQL error handlers be sure to indicate to the user if there is any issue with storing data.
- For single statement and batch transactions include an error callback with logic that indicates to the user if data cannot be stored for any reason.

<!-- Avoiding data loss -->

## Known issues

- This plugin will NOT work on `cordova-android@7` due to issue with JAR and NDK library files as discussed in [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#729](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/729).
- The iOS/macOS platform versions do not support certain rapidly repeated open-and-close or open-and-delete test scenarios due to how the implementation handles background processing
- The Android platform version does not always handle four-byte UTF-8 characters emoji characters such as `\u1F603` (SMILING FACE, MOUTH OPEN) correctly ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#564](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/564). It is sometimes possible to store and retrieve such characters but certain operations such as hex conversions do not work properly when using the default [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) database implementation. It is suspected that such characters would be stored incorrectly by the default Android platform version. Note that this is not an issue in case the built-in Android database is used (using the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` setting in `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase`)
- It is possible to request a SQL statement list such as "SELECT 1; SELECT 2" within a single SQL statement string, however the plugin will only execute the first statement and silently ignore the others ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#551](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/551)
- Execution of INSERT statement that affects multiple rows (due to SELECT cause or using TRIGGER(s), for example) reports incorrect rowsAffected on Android in case the built-in Android database used (using the `androidDatabaseImplementation` option in `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase`)
- Memory issue observed when adding a large number of records due to the JSON implementation which is improved in [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free) (GPL or commercial license terms)
- Infinity (positive or negative) values are not supported on Android/iOS/macOS due to issues described above including a possible crash on iOS/macOS ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#405](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/405)
- A stability issue was reported on the iOS platform version when in use together with [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client such as [pusher-js](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js) at the same time (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#196](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/196)). The workaround is to call sqlite functions and [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client functions in separate ticks (using setTimeout with 0 timeout).
- FIXED for Android in newer plugin versions such as [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage), [litehelpers / cordova-sqlite-ext](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-ext), and [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free): In case of an error, the error `code` member is bogus on Android and Windows.
- Possible crash on Android when using Unicode emoji and other 4-octet UTF-8 characters due to [Android bug 81341](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=81341), which *should* be fixed in Android 6.x
- Close/delete database bugs described below.
- When a database is opened and deleted without closing, the iOS/macOS platform version is known to leak resources.
- It is NOT possible to open multiple databases with the same name but in different locations (iOS/macOS platform version).

### Issues fixed in newer version branches

- Incorrect or missing insertId/rowsAffected in results for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE SQL statements with extra semicolon(s) in the beginning for Android platform version in case the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` (built-in android.database implementation) option is used.
- In case of an error, the error `code` member is bogus on Android
- Windows platform version reports NONCOMPLIANT error code (-1) in case of an error
- iOS platform version generates extra logging in release build
- iOS platform version may crash if deleteDatabase is called with an object in place of the database name
- readTransaction does not reject ALTER, REINDEX, and REPLACE operations
- readTransaction does *not* reject modification statements with extra semicolon(s) in the beginning
- extra executeSql callbacks: if a sql statement fails for which there is no error handler or the error handler does not return `false` to signal transaction recovery, the plugin fires the remaining sql callbacks before aborting the transaction.
- does not signal an error in case of excess parameter argument values given on iOS/macOS

Some additional issues are tracked in [open Cordova-sqlite-storage bug-general issues](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug-general) and [open Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free bug issues](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug).

<!-- END Known issues -->

## Other limitations

- The db version, display name, and size parameter values are not supported and will be ignored.
- Absolute and relative subdirectory path(s) are not tested or supported.
- This plugin will not work before the callback for the 'deviceready' event has been fired, as described in **Usage**. (This is consistent with the other Cordova plugins.)
- Extremely large records are not supported by this plugin. It is recommended to store images and similar binary data in separate files. TBD: specify maximum record. For future consideration: support in a plugin version such as [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free) (GPL or commercial license terms).
- This plugin version will not work within a web worker (not properly supported by the Cordova framework). Use within a web worker is supported for Android/iOS in [litehelpers / cordova-sqlite-evmax-ext-workers-legacy-build-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-evmax-ext-workers-legacy-build-free) (GPL or premium commercial license terms).
- In-memory database `db=window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: ':memory:', ...})` is currently not supported.
- The Android platform version cannot properly support more than 100 open database files due to the threading model used.
- SQL error messages reported by Windows platform version are not consistent with Android/iOS/macOS platform versions.
- UNICODE `\u2028` (line separator) and `\u2029` (paragraph separator) characters are currently not supported and known to be broken on iOS, macOS, and Android platform versions due to JSON issues reported in [Cordova bug CB-9435](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-9435) and [cordova/cordova-discuss#57](https://github.com/cordova/cordova-discuss/issues/57). This is fixed with a workaround for iOS/macOS in: [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-free) and [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free) (GPL or special commercial license terms) as well as [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-workers-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-workers-free) (GPL or premium commercial license terms).
- The BLOB data type is not fully supported on Windows in this version branch. SELECT BLOB with BASE64 conversion function for Android/iOS/macOS/Windows is supported by [litehelpers / cordova-sqlite-ext](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-ext) (permissive license terms) and [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free) (GPL or commercial license terms).
- Truncation in case of UNICODE `\u0000` (same as `\0`) character on Android (default Android-sqlite-connector database implementation) and Windows.
- Case-insensitive matching and other string manipulations on Unicode characters, which is provided by optional ICU integration in the sqlite source and working with recent versions of Android, is not supported for any target platforms.
- The iOS/macOS platform version uses a thread pool but with only one thread working at a time due to "synchronized" database access.
- Some large query results may be slow, also due to the JSON implementation.
- UPDATE/DELETE with LIMIT or ORDER BY is not supported.
- WITH clause is not supported on some older Android platform versions in case the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` (built-in android.database implementation) option is used.
- User-defined savepoints are not supported and not expected to be compatible with the transaction locking mechanism used by this plugin. In addition, the use of BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK statements is not supported.
- Problems have been reported when using this plugin with Crosswalk (for Android). It may help to install Crosswalk as a plugin instead of using Crosswalk to create the project.
- Does not work with [axemclion / react-native-cordova-plugin](https://github.com/axemclion/react-native-cordova-plugin) since the `window.sqlitePlugin` object is *not* properly exported (ES5 feature). It is recommended to use [andpor / react-native-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage) for SQLite database access with React Native Android/iOS instead.

Additional limitations are tracked in [marked Cordova-sqlite-storage doc-todo issues](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Adoc-todo).

<!-- END Further testing needed -->

## Some tips and tricks

- If you run into problems and your code follows the asynchronous HTML5/[Web SQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) transaction API, you can try opening a test database using `window.openDatabase` and see if you get the same problems.
- In case your database schema may change, it is recommended to keep a table with one row and one column to keep track of your own schema version number. It is possible to add it later. The recommended schema update procedure is described below.

<!-- END Some tips and tricks -->

## Pitfalls

### Some common pitfall(s)

- If a database is opened using the standard `window.openDatabase` call it will not have any of the benefits of this plugin and features such as the `sqlBatch` call would not be available.
- It is NOT allowed to execute sql statements on a transaction that has already finished, as described below. This is consistent with the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).
- The plugin class name starts with "SQL" in capital letters, but in Javascript the `sqlitePlugin` object name starts with "sql" in small letters.
- Attempting to open a database before receiving the 'deviceready' event callback.
- Inserting STRING into ID field
- Auto-vacuum is NOT enabled by default. It is recommended to periodically VACUUM the database. If no form of `VACUUM` or `PRAGMA auto_vacuum` is used then sqlite will automatically reuse deleted data space for new data but the database file will never shrink. For reference: <http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum> and [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#646](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/646)
- Transactions on a database are run sequentially. A large transaction could block smaller transactions requested afterwards.

### Some weird pitfall(s)

- intent whitelist: blocked intent such as external URL intent *may* cause this and perhaps certain Cordova plugin(s) to misbehave (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#396](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/396))

### Angular/ngCordova/Ionic-related pitfalls

- Angular/ngCordova/Ionic controller/factory/service callbacks may be triggered before the 'deviceready' event is fired
- As discussed in [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#355](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/355), it may be necessary to install ionic-plugin-keyboard
- Navigation items such as root page can be tricky on Ionic 2 ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#613](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/613)

# Usage

## Self-test functions

To verify that both the Javascript and native part of this plugin are installed in your application:

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.echoTest(successCallback, errorCallback);
```

To verify that this plugin is able to open a database (named `___$$$___litehelpers___$$$___test___$$$___.db`), execute the CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations, and clean it up properly:

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.selfTest(successCallback, errorCallback);
```

**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the 'deviceready' event (see below for an example).

## General

- Drop-in replacement for HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/): the only change should be to replace the static `window.openDatabase()` factory call with `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`, with parameters as documented below. Some known deviations are documented in TBD newer version branches. Reports of any additional deviations would be appreciated.
- Single-page application design is recommended.
- In case of a multi-page application the JavaScript used by each page must use `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` to open the database access handle object before it can access the data.

**NOTE:** If a sqlite statement in a transaction fails with an error, the error handler *must* return `false` in order to recover the transaction. This is correct according to the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) standard. This is different from the WebKit implementation of Web SQL in Android and iOS which recovers the transaction if a sql error hander returns a non-`true` value.

## Opening a database

There are two options to open a database access object:
- **Recommended:** `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'}, successcb, errorcb);`
- **Classical:** `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("myDatabase.db", "1.0", "Demo", -1);`

The `location` option is used to specify the database subdirectory location (iOS/macOS *only*):
- ~~`0`: `Documents` - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud~~ (disabled in this version)
- ~~`1`: `Library` - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes~~ (disabled in this version)
- `2` *(default)*: `Library/LocalDatabase` - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud (same as using "default")

**WARNING:** The new "default" location value is *NOT* the same as the old default location _(in other version such as cordova-sqlite-storage and cordova-sqlite-ext)_ and would break an upgrade for an app that was using the old default value (0) on iOS.

**WARNING 2:** As described above: by default this plugin uses a non-standard [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) implementation on Android. In case an application access the **same** database using multiple plugins there is a risk of data corruption ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#626](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/626)) as described in <http://ericsink.com/entries/multiple_sqlite_problem.html> and <https://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html>. The workaround is to use the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` setting as described in the **Android sqlite implementation** section below.

To specify a different location (affects iOS/macOS *only*):

(TBD) NOT SUPPORTED by this version: ~~To specify a different location (affects iOS/macOS *only*):~~

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', iosDatabaseLocation: 'Library'}, successcb, errorcb);
```

where the `iosDatabaseLocation` option may be set to one of the following choices:
- `default`: `Library/LocalDatabase` subdirectory - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud
- ~~`Library`: `Library` subdirectory - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes~~ _(disabled in this version)_
- ~~`Documents`: `Documents` subdirectory - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud~~ _(disabled in this version)_

**WARNING:** Again, the new "default" iosDatabaseLocation value is *NOT* the same as the old default location _(in other version such as cordova-sqlite-storage and cordova-sqlite-ext)_ and would break an upgrade for an app using the old default value (0) on iOS.

*ALTERNATIVE (deprecated):*
- `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 2}, successcb, errorcb);`

with the `location` option set to one the following choices (affects iOS *only*):
- ~~`0`~~ (default): `Documents` - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud~~ _(disabled in this version)_
- ~~`1`: `Library` - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes~~ _(disabled in this version)_
- `2`: `Library/LocalDatabase` - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud (same as using "default")

**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the 'deviceready' event, as in the following example:

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'});
  // ...
}
```

The successcb and errorcb callback parameters are optional but can be extremely helpful in case anything goes wrong. For example:

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'}, function(db) {
  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    // ...
  }, function(err) {
    console.log('Open database ERROR: ' + JSON.stringify(err));
  });
});
```

If any sql statements or transactions are attempted on a database object before the openDatabase result is known, they will be queued and will be aborted in case the database cannot be opened.

**DATABASE NAME NOTES:**

- Database file names with slash (`/`) character(s) are not supported and not expected to work.
- Database file names with ASCII control characters such as tab, vertical tab, carriage return, line feed, form feed, and backspace are not supported and do not work on Windows.
- Some other ASCII characters not supported and not working on Windows: `*` `<` `>` `?` `\` `"` `|`
- Database file names with emojis and other 4-octet UTF-8 characters are NOT RECOMMENDED.

**OTHER NOTES:**
- The database file name should include the extension, if desired.
- It is possible to open multiple database access handle objects for the same database.
- The database handle access object can be closed as described below.

**Web SQL replacement tip:**

To overwrite `window.openDatabase`:

```Javascript
window.openDatabase = function(dbname, ignored1, ignored2, ignored3) {
  return window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: dbname, location: 'default'});
};
```

### Pre-populated database(s)

Put the database file in the `www` directory and open the database like:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", createFromLocation: 1});
```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Put the pre-populated database file in the `www` subdirectory.
- The pre-populated database file name must match **exactly** the file name given in `openDatabase`. This plugin does *not* use an automatic extension.
- The pre-populated database file is ignored if the database file with the same name already exists in the database file location.

**TIP:** If you don't see the data from the pre-populated database file, completely remove your app and try it again!

**Alternative:** You can also use [an-rahulpandey / cordova-plugin-dbcopy](https://github.com/an-rahulpandey/cordova-plugin-dbcopy) to install a pre-populated database

- https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-pre-populated-db-example-android (based on Cordova 2.7)

### Android sqlite implementation

By default, this plugin uses [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector), which is lightweight and should be more efficient than the built-in Android database classes. To use the built-in Android database classes instead:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default', androidDatabaseImplementation: 2});
```

**NOTE:** The internal memory improvements do *not* apply to the use of the built-in Android database classes.

**IMPORTANT:**
- As described above: by default this plugin uses a non-standard [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) implementation on Android. In case an application access the **same** database using multiple plugins there is a risk of data corruption ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#626](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/626)) as described in <http://ericsink.com/entries/multiple_sqlite_problem.html> and <https://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html>. The workaround is to use the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` setting as described here.
- In case of the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` setting, [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#193](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/193) reported (as observed by a number of app developers in the past) that in certain Android versions, if the app is stopped or aborted without closing the database then there is an unexpected database lock and the data that was inserted is lost. The workaround is described below.

### Workaround for Android db locking issue

[litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#193](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/193) reported (as observed by a number of app developers in the past) that when using the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` setting on certain Android versions and if the app is stopped or aborted without closing the database then:
- (sometimes) there is an unexpected database lock
- the data that was inserted is lost.

The cause of this issue remains unknown. Of interest: [android / platform_external_sqlite commit d4f30d0d15](https://github.com/android/platform_external_sqlite/commit/d4f30d0d1544f8967ee5763c4a1680cb0553039f) which references and includes the sqlite commit at: http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/6c4c2b7dba

This is *not* an issue when default [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) database implementation.

There is an optional workaround that simply closes and reopens the database file at the end of every transaction that is committed. The workaround is enabled by opening the database with options as follows:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({
  name: 'my.db',
  location: 'default',
  androidDatabaseImplementation: 2,
  androidLockWorkaround: 1
});
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This workaround is *only* applied when using `db.sqlBatch` or `db.transaction()`, *not* applied when running `executeSql()` on the database object.

<!-- END Workaround for Android db locking issue -->

## SQL transactions

The following types of SQL transactions are supported by this plugin version:
- Single-statement transactions
- SQL batch transactions
- Standard asynchronous transactions
- Multi-part transactions

**NOTE:** Transaction requests are kept in one queue per database and executed in sequential order, according to the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).

**WARNING:** It is possible to request a SQL statement list such as "SELECT 1; SELECT 2" within a single SQL statement string, however the plugin will only execute the first statement and silently ignore the others. This could result in data loss if such a SQL statement list with any INSERT or UPDATE statement(s) are included. For reference: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#551](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/551)

### Single-statement transactions

Sample with INSERT:

```Javascript
db.executeSql('INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?)', ['test-value'], function (resultSet) {
  console.log('resultSet.insertId: ' + resultSet.insertId);
  console.log('resultSet.rowsAffected: ' + resultSet.rowsAffected);
}, function(error) {
  console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);
});
```

Sample with SELECT:

```Javascript
db.executeSql("SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength", [], function (resultSet) {
  console.log('got stringlength: ' + resultSet.rows.item(0).stringlength);
}, function(error) {
  console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);
});
```

**NOTE/minor bug:** The object returned by `resultSet.rows.item(rowNumber)` is **not** immutable. In addition, multiple calls to `resultSet.rows.item(rowNumber)` with the same `rowNumber` on the same `resultSet` object return the same object. For example, the following code will show `Second uppertext result: ANOTHER`:

```Javascript
db.executeSql("SELECT UPPER('First') AS uppertext", [], function (resultSet) {
  var obj1 = resultSet.rows.item(0);
  obj1.uppertext = 'ANOTHER';
  console.log('Second uppertext result: ' + resultSet.rows.item(0).uppertext);
  console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);
});
```

<!-- END Single-statement transactions -->

### SQL batch transactions

Sample:

```Javascript
db.sqlBatch([
  'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MyTable',
  'CREATE TABLE MyTable (SampleColumn)',
  [ 'INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?)', ['test-value'] ],
], function() {
  db.executeSql('SELECT * FROM MyTable', [], function (resultSet) {
    console.log('Sample column value: ' + resultSet.rows.item(0).SampleColumn);
  });
}, function(error) {
  console.log('Populate table error: ' + error.message);
});
```

In case of an error, all changes in a sql batch are automatically discarded using ROLLBACK.

<!-- END SQL batch transactions -->

### Standard asynchronous transactions

Standard asynchronous transactions follow the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) which is very well documented and uses BEGIN and COMMIT or ROLLBACK to keep the transactions failure-safe. Here is a simple example:

```Javascript
db.transaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MyTable');
  tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE MyTable (SampleColumn)');
  tx.executeSql('INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?)', ['test-value'], function(tx, resultSet) {
    console.log('resultSet.insertId: ' + resultSet.insertId);
    console.log('resultSet.rowsAffected: ' + resultSet.rowsAffected);
  }, function(tx, error) {
    console.log('INSERT error: ' + error.message);
  });
}, function(error) {
  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);
}, function() {
  console.log('transaction ok');
});
```

In case of a read-only transaction, it is possible to use `readTransaction` which will not use BEGIN, COMMIT, or ROLLBACK:

```Javascript
db.readTransaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql("SELECT UPPER('Some US-ASCII text') AS uppertext", [], function(tx, resultSet) {
    console.log("resultSet.rows.item(0).uppertext: " + resultSet.rows.item(0).uppertext);
  }, function(tx, error) {
    console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);
  });
}, function(error) {
  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);
}, function() {
  console.log('transaction ok');
});
```

**WARNING:** It is NOT allowed to execute sql statements on a transaction after it has finished. Here is an example from the **Populating Cordova SQLite storage with the JQuery API post** at <http://www.brodybits.com/cordova/sqlite/api/jquery/2015/10/26/populating-cordova-sqlite-storage-with-the-jquery-api.html>:

```Javascript
  // BROKEN SAMPLE:
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "test.db"});
  db.executeSql("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tt");
  db.executeSql("CREATE TABLE tt (data)");

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    $.ajax({
      url: 'https://api.github.com/users/litehelpers/repos',
      dataType: 'json',
      success: function(res) {
        console.log('Got AJAX response: ' + JSON.stringify(res));
        $.each(res, function(i, item) {
          console.log('REPO NAME: ' + item.name);
          tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO tt values (?)", JSON.stringify(item.name));
        });
      }
    });
  }, function(e) {
    console.log('Transaction error: ' + e.message);
  }, function() {
    // Check results:
    db.executeSql('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tt', [], function(res) {
      console.log('Check SELECT result: ' + JSON.stringify(res.rows.item(0)));
    });
  });
```

You can find more details and a step-by-step description how to do this right in the **Populating Cordova SQLite storage with the JQuery API** post at: <http://www.brodybits.com/cordova/sqlite/api/jquery/2015/10/26/populating-cordova-sqlite-storage-with-the-jquery-api.html>

**NOTE/minor bug:** Just like the single-statement transaction described above, the object returned by `resultSet.rows.item(rowNumber)` is **not** immutable. In addition, multiple calls to `resultSet.rows.item(rowNumber)` with the same `rowNumber` on the same `resultSet` object return the same object. For example, the following code will show `Second uppertext result: ANOTHER`:

```Javascript
db.readTransaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql("SELECT UPPER('First') AS uppertext", [], function(tx, resultSet) {
    var obj1 = resultSet.rows.item(0);
    obj1.uppertext = 'ANOTHER';
    console.log('Second uppertext result: ' + resultSet.rows.item(0).uppertext);
    console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);
  });
});
```

**FUTURE TBD:** It should be possible to get a row result object using `resultSet.rows[rowNumber]`, also in case of a single-statement transaction. This is non-standard but is supported by the Chrome desktop browser.

### Multi-part transactions

Sample (with success and error callbacks):

```Javascript
var tx = db.beginTransaction();
tx.executeSql("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable");
tx.executeSql("CREATE TABLE mytable (myfield)");

tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO mytable values(?)", ['test value']);
tx.executeSql("SELECT * from mytable", [], function(tx, res) {
  console.log("Got value: " + res.rows.item(0).myfield);
}, function(tx, e) {
  console.log("Ignore unexpected error callback with message: " + e.message);
  return false;
});

tx.end(function() {
  console.log('Optional success callback fired');
}, function(e) {
  console.log("Optional error callback fired with message: " + e.message);
});
```

Sample with abort:

```Javascript
var tx = db.beginTransaction();
tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO mytable values(?)", ['wrong data']);
tx.abort(function() {
  console.log('Optional callback');
});
```

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- In case a `tx.executeSql` call results in an error and it does not have an error callback or the error callback does NOT return `false`, the transaction will be aborted *immediately* with a ROLLBACK ~~upon the `tx.end` call~~.
- **BUG:** If a `tx.executeSql` call results in an error for which there is no error callback, the error callback does NOT return `false`, or the error callback throws an exception, the transaction is silently aborted and no `tx.end` callbacks will be fired.
- When a multi-part transaction is started by the `db.beginTransaction` call, all other transactions are blocked until the multi-part transaction is either completed successfully or aborted (with a ROLLBACK).

<!-- END Multi-part transactions -->

## Background processing

The threading model depends on which platform version is used:
- For Android, one background thread per db;
- for iOS/macOS, background processing using a very limited thread pool (only one thread working at a time);
- for Windows, no background processing.

<!-- END Background processing -->

## Sample with PRAGMA feature

Creates a table, adds a single entry, then queries the count to check if the item was inserted as expected. Note that a new transaction is created in the middle of the first callback.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'});

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    // demonstrate PRAGMA:
    db.executeSql("pragma table_info (test_table);", [], function(res) {
      console.log("PRAGMA res: " + JSON.stringify(res));
    });

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      db.transaction(function(tx) {
        tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
          console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
          console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
        });
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

**NOTE:** PRAGMA statements must be executed in `executeSql()` on the database object (i.e. `db.executeSql()`) and NOT within a transaction.

<!-- END Sample with PRAGMA feature -->

## Sample with transaction-level nesting

In this case, the same transaction in the first executeSql() callback is being reused to run executeSql() again.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'});

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
        console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
        console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
      });

    }, function(tx, e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

This case will also works with Safari (WebKit), assuming you replace `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` with `window.openDatabase`.

<!-- END Sample with transaction-level nesting -->

## Attach to another database

To attach to another database in the default location:

```Javascript
db.attach('alias_name', 'dbfilename', optionalSuccessCallback, optionalErrorCallback);
```

**NOTE:** For Android the database *must* be opened with the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` option (FUTURE TBD).

### Detach

```Javascript
db.detach('alias_name', optionalSuccessCallback, optionalErrorCallback);
```

### To list attached databases

```Javascript
db.executeSql('PRAGMA database_list', [], function(res) {
  console.log('alias: ' + res.rows.item(1).name);
  console.log('file: ' + res.rows.item(1).file);
});
```

For more information: http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_database_list

## Close a database object

This will invalidate **all** handle access handle objects for the database that is closed:

```js
db.close(successcb, errorcb);
```

It is OK to close the database within a transaction callback but *NOT* within a statement callback. The following example is OK:

```Javascript
db.transaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql("SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength", [], function(tx, res) {
    console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);
  });
}, function(error) {
  // OK to close here:
  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);
  db.close();
}, function() {
  // OK to close here:
  console.log('transaction ok');
  db.close(function() {
    console.log('database is closed ok');
  });
});
```

The following example is NOT OK:

```Javascript
// BROKEN:
db.transaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql("SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength", [], function(tx, res) {
    console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);
    // BROKEN - this will trigger the error callback:
    db.close(function() {
      console.log('database is closed ok');
    }, function(error) {
      console.log('ERROR closing database');
    });
  });
});
```

**BUG:** It is currently NOT possible to close a database in a `db.executeSql` callback. For example:

```Javascript
// BROKEN DUE TO BUG:
db.executeSql("SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength", [], function (res) {
  var stringlength = res.rows.item(0).stringlength;
  console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);

  // BROKEN - this will trigger the error callback DUE TO BUG:
  db.close(function() {
    console.log('database is closed ok');
  }, function(error) {
    console.log('ERROR closing database');
  });
});
```

**SECOND BUG:** When a database connection is closed, any queued transactions are left hanging. TODO: All pending transactions should be errored whenever a database connection is closed.

**NOTE:** As described above, if multiple database access handle objects are opened for the same database and one database handle access object is closed, the database is no longer available for the other database handle objects. Possible workarounds:
- It is still possible to open one or more new database handle objects on a database that has been closed.
- It *should* be OK not to explicitly close a database handle since database transactions are [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) compliant and the app's memory resources are cleaned up by the system upon termination.

**FUTURE TBD:** `dispose` method on the database access handle object, such that a database is closed once **all** access handle objects are disposed.

<!-- END Close a database object -->

## Delete a database

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'}, successcb, errorcb);
```

with `location` or `iosDatabaseLocation` parameter *required* as described above for `openDatabase` (affects iOS/macOS *only*)

Alternative supported by this version:

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase(name: 'my.db', successcb, errorcb);
```

**BUG:** When a database is deleted, any queued transactions for that database are left hanging. TODO: All pending transactions should be errored when a database is deleted.

<!-- END Delete a database -->

## Database schema versions

The transactional nature of the API makes it relatively straightforward to manage a database schema that may be upgraded over time (adding new columns or new tables, for example). Here is the recommended procedure to follow upon app startup:
- Check your database schema version number (you can use `db.executeSql` since it should be a very simple query)
- If your database needs to be upgraded, do the following *within a single transaction* to be failure-safe:
  - Create your database schema version table (single row single column) if it does not exist (you can check the `sqlite_master` table as described at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1601151/how-do-i-check-in-sqlite-whether-a-table-exists)
  - Add any missing columns and tables, and apply any other changes necessary

**IMPORTANT:** Since we cannot be certain when the users will actually update their apps, old schema versions will have to be supported for a very long time.

<!-- END Database schema versions -->

# Installing

## Easy installation with Cordova CLI tool

    npm install -g cordova # (in case you don't have cordova)
    cordova create MyProjectFolder com.my.project MyProject && cd MyProjectFolder # if you are just starting
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free

**CLI NOTES:**

- You *may* have to update the platform and plugin version(s) before you can build: `cordova prepare` (or for a specific platform such as iOS: `cordova prepare ios`)
- If you cannot build for a platform after `cordova prepare`, you may have to remove the platform and add it again, such as:

```shell
cordova platform rm ios
cordova platform add ios
```

or more drastically:

```shell
rm -rf platforms
cordova platform add ios
```

<!-- END Easy installation with Cordova CLI tool -->

## Plugin installation sources

- https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free - latest version

<!-- END Plugin installation sources -->

## Installation test

### Easy installation test

Use `window.sqlitePlugin.echoTest` and/or `window.sqlitePlugin.selfTest` as described above (please wait for the `deviceready` event).

### Quick installation test

Assuming your app has a recent template as used by the Cordova create script, add the following code to the `onDeviceReady` function, after `app.receivedEvent('deviceready');`:

```Javascript
  window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({ name: 'hello-world.db', location: 'default' }, function (db) {
    db.executeSql("select length('tenletters') as stringlength", [], function (res) {
      var stringlength = res.rows.item(0).stringlength;
      console.log('got stringlength: ' + stringlength);
      document.getElementById('deviceready').querySelector('.received').innerHTML = 'stringlength: ' + stringlength;
   });
  });
```

<!-- END Installation test -->

# Support

## Policy

Free support is provided on a best-effort basis and is only available in public forums. Please follow the steps below to be sure you have done your best before requesting help.

Commercial support is available by contacting: <sales@litehelpers.net>

## Before seeking help

First steps:
- Verify that you have followed the steps in [brodybits / Cordova-quick-start-checklist](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-quick-start-checklist)
- Try the new self-test functions as described above
- Check the troubleshooting steps and pitfalls in [brodybits / Avoiding-some-Cordova-pitfalls](https://github.com/brodybits/Avoiding-some-Cordova-pitfalls) for possible troubleshooting

and check the following:
- You are using the latest version of the Plugin (Javascript and platform-specific part) from this repository.
- The plugin is installed correctly.
- You have included the correct version of `cordova.js`.
- You have registered the plugin properly in `config.xml`.

If you still cannot get something to work:
- create a fresh, clean Cordova project;
- add this plugin according to the instructions above;
- double-check that you follwed the steps in [brodybits / Cordova-quick-start-checklist](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-quick-start-checklist);
- try a simple test program;
- double-check the pitfalls in [brodybits / Avoiding-some-Cordova-pitfalls](https://github.com/brodybits/Avoiding-some-Cordova-pitfalls)

If you continue to see the issue in the fresh, clean Cordova project:
- Make the simplest test program you can to demonstrate the issue, including the following characteristics:
  - it completely self-contained, i.e. it is using no extra libraries beyond cordova & SQLitePlugin.js;
  - if the issue is with *adding* data to a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database and create the table;
  - if the issue is with *retrieving* data from a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database, create the table, and enter the data you are trying to retrieve.

Then you can [raise the new issue](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free/issues/new).

## What will be supported for free

Please make a small, self-contained test program that can demonstrate your problem and post it. Please do not use any other plugins or frameworks than are absolutely necessary to demonstrate your problem.

In case of a problem with a pre-populated database, please post your entire project.

## Support for issues with Angular/"ngCordova"/Ionic

Free support for issues with Angular/"ngCordova"/Ionic will only be provided if you can demonstrate that you can do the same thing without such a framework.
- Make a fresh, clean ngCordova or Ionic project with a test program that demonstrates the issue and post it. Please do not use any other plugins or frameworks unless absolutely necessary to demonstrate your issue.
- Make another project without any form of Angular including ngCordova or Ionic, with the same test program to show that it will work outside Angular/"ngCordova"/Ionic.

## What information is needed for help

Please include the following:
- Which platform(s) (Android/iOS/macOS/Windows)
- Clear description of the issue
- A small, complete, self-contained program that demonstrates the problem, preferably as a Github project. ZIP/TGZ/BZ2 archive available from a public link is OK. No RAR or other such formats please!
- A Cordova project is highly preferred. Intel, MS IDE, or similar project formats should be avoided.

## Please do NOT use any of these formats

- screen casts or videos
- RAR or similar archive formats
- Intel, MS IDE, or similar project formats unless absolutely necessary

## Where to ask for help

Once you have followed the directions above, you may request free support in the following location(s):
- [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-help](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-help)
- issues page [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free / issues](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free/issues)
