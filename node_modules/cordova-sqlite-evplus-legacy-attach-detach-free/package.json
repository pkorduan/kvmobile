  "readme": "# Cordova/PhoneGap sqlite storage - premium enterprise version with legacy support for memory improvements, ATTACH/DETACH (Android/iOS/macOS), and TBD other extra features\n \nNative interface to sqlite in a Cordova/PhoneGap plugin for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows 10 UWP (Universal Windows Platform), with API similar to HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).\n\nThis version includes memory improvements and TBD other extra features.\n\nThis version is available under GPL v3 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt) or a premium commercial license.\n\nTBD: no Circle CI or Travis CI working in this version branch.\n\nNOTE: Commercial licenses for Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free purchased before July 2016 are valid for this version. Commercial licenses for Cordova-sqlite-evcore versions are *not* valid for this version.\n\n## IMPORTANT: iCloud backup of SQLite database is NOT allowed\n\nAs documented in the \"**A User’s iCloud Storage Is Limited**\" section of [iCloudFundamentals in Mac Developer Library iCloud Design Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/iCloudFundametals.html) (near the beginning):\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><b>DO</b> store the following in iCloud:\n  <ul>\n   <li>[<i>other items omitted</i>]</li>\n   <li>Change log files for a SQLite database (a SQLite database’s store file must never be stored in iCloud)</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><b>DO NOT</b> store the following in iCloud:\n  <ul>\n   <li>[<i>items omitted</i>]</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n- <cite><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/iCloudFundametals.html\">iCloudFundamentals in Mac Developer Library iCloud Design Guide</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n### How to disable iCloud backup\n\n**Already fixed in this version:** ~~Use the `location` option in `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` to store the database in a subdirectory that is *NOT* backed up to iCloud, as described in the section below.~~\n\n**NOTE:** Changing `BackupWebStorage` in `config.xml` has no effect on a database created by this plugin. `BackupWebStorage` applies only to local storage and/or Web SQL storage created in the WebView (*not* using this plugin). For reference: [phonegap/build#338 (comment)](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/338#issuecomment-113328140)\n\n## Status\n\n- A recent version of the Cordova CLI (such as `6.5.0`) is recommended. Cordova versions older than `6.0.0` are missing the `cordova-ios@4.0.0` security fixes. In addition it is *required* to use `cordova prepare` in case of cordova-ios older than `4.3.0` (Cordova CLI `6.4.0`).\n- Default location for iOS is `Library/LocalDatabase`, will *not* be backed up to iCloud (may **not** be changed in this version)\n- Free support is available in [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free / issues](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free/issues); premium commercial support is available by contacting: sales@litehelpers.net\n- Patches patches will *NOT* be accepted on this project due to potential licensing issues.\n- Status for the target platforms:\n  - Android: now using [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) (with sqlite `3.8.10.2`), with support for FTS3/FTS4 and R-Tree, and REGEXP support using PCRE 8.37 as built from [liteglue / Android-sqlite-native-driver-regexp-pcre](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-native-driver-regexp-pcre)\n  - iOS/macOS/Windows: sqlite `3.8.10.2` embedded\n- Windows version is TBD:\n  - Issue with UNICODE `\\u0000` character (same as `\\0`)\n  - No background processing (for future consideration)\n  - Visual Studio 2015 required. This version branch does not support Visual Studio 2017.\n  - TBD other known issues\n- FTS3 and FTS4 are tested working OK in this version branch (for all target platforms in this version branch Android/iOS/macOS)\n- R-Tree is *not* tested or supported for Android in this version branch.\n- Android is supported back to SDK 10 (a.k.a. Gingerbread, Android 2.3.3); support for older versions is available upon request.\n- iOS versions supported: 8.x/9.x/10.x\n\n<!-- END Status -->\n\n## Announcements\n\n- Resolved transaction problem after window.location (page) change with possible data loss ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#666](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/666)\n- [brodybits / cordova-sqlite-test-app](https://github.com/brodybits/cordova-sqlite-test-app) project is a CC0 (public domain) starting point (NOTE that this plugin must be added) and may also be used to reproduce issues with this plugin.\n- The Lawnchair adapter is now moved to [litehelpers / cordova-sqlite-lawnchair-adapter](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-lawnchair-adapter).\n- [brodybits / sql-promise-helper](https://github.com/brodybits/sql-promise-helper) provides a Promise-based API wrapper.\n- [nolanlawson / pouchdb-adapter-cordova-sqlite](https://github.com/nolanlawson/pouchdb-adapter-cordova-sqlite) supports this plugin along with other implementations such as [nolanlawson / sqlite-plugin-2](https://github.com/nolanlawson/sqlite-plugin-2) and [Microsoft / cordova-plugin-websql](https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-websql).\n- macOS (\"osx\" platform) is now supported\n- Published [brodybits / Cordova-quick-start-checklist](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-quick-start-checklist) and [brodybits / Avoiding-some-Cordova-pitfalls](https://github.com/brodybits/Avoiding-some-Cordova-pitfalls).\n- Self-test functions to verify proper installation and operation of this plugin\n- More explicit `openDatabase` and `deleteDatabase` `iosDatabaseLocation` option\n- Added simple sql batch function\n- Support for reading BLOB values (from pre-populated databases) for Android/iOS/macOS\n- ATTACH/DETACH is now supported as described below.\n- Windows 10 UWP is now supported by this version\n- Added echo test function to verify installation of this plugin\n- Pre-populated database support for Android, iOS, macOS, ~~and Windows (TBD BROKEN)~~, usage described below\n- Published [brodybits / Cordova-quick-start-checklist](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-quick-start-checklist) and [brodybits / Cordova-troubleshooting-guide](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-troubleshooting-guide)\n- REGEXP is now supported for Android/iOS/macOS platforms.\n- This version has the following improvement(s):\n  - iOS/macOS version can now handle all UNICODE characters, using URI encoding as a workaround for [Cordova bug CB-9435](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-9435).\n  - Multi-part transactions API (described below)\n  - TBD *missing in this version*: ~~Error result with proper Web SQL `code` member and `sqliteCode` as reported by the SQLite C library (Android/iOS)~~\n  - flat JSON interface between Javascript and native parts\n  - *optional*: transaction sql chunking, which can be enabled by changing the `MAX_SQL_CHUNK` value in SQLitePlugin.js\n- A version with support for web workers is available at: [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-workers-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-workers-free)\n- Published [brodybits / Cordova-quick-start-checklist](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-quick-start-checklist) and [brodybits / Cordova-troubleshooting-guide](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-troubleshooting-guide)\n- PhoneGap Build is now supported through the npm package: http://phonegap.com/blog/2015/05/26/npm-plugins-available/ (Android/iOS ONLY)\n- [MetaMemoryT / websql-promise](https://github.com/MetaMemoryT/websql-promise) now provides a Promises-based interface to both Web SQL and this plugin\n- [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) for Android/iOS/macOS/Windows is supported by [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter)\n\n<!-- END Announcements -->\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Drop-in replacement for HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/): the only change should be to replace the static `window.openDatabase()` factory call with `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`, with parameters as documented below.\n- Failure-safe nested transactions with batch processing optimizations (according to HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/))\n- API (based on HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/)) is designed to be as flexible as possible but does not allow the application to leave any transactions hanging open.\n- Pre-populated openDatabase option (usage described below)\n- As described in [this posting](http://brodyspark.blogspot.com/2012/12/cordovaphonegap-sqlite-plugins-offer.html):\n  - Keeps sqlite database in a user data location that is known (TBD cannot be reconfigured in this version branch)\n  - No 5MB maximum, more information at: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html\n- Also tested for multi-page applications with window location changes\n- This project is self-contained: no dependencies on other plugins such as cordova-plugin-file\n- Windows 10 UWP platform version available in [litehelpers / cordova-sqlite-ext](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-ext) and Windows 8.1/Windows Phone 8.1/Windows 10 platform version available in [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-legacy](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-legacy) use the performant C++ [doo / SQLite3-WinRT](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT) component.\n- [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) support for Android/iOS/macOS/Windows is available in: [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter)\n- Intellectual property:\n  - All source code is tracked to the original author in git\n  - Major authors are tracked in AUTHORS.md\n  - License of each component is tracked in LICENSE.md\n  - History of this project is also described in HISTORY.md\n\n**TIP:** It is possible to migrate from Cordova to a pure native solution and continue using the data stored by this plugin.\n\n<!-- END Highlights -->\n\n## Some apps using this plugin\n\nTBD *your app here*\n\n<!-- END Some apps using this plugin -->\n\n## Security\n\n### Security of sensitive data\n\nAccording to [Web SQL Database API 7.2 Sensitivity of data](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#sensitivity-of-data):\n>User agents should treat persistently stored data as potentially sensitive; it's quite possible for e-mails, calendar appointments, health records, or other confidential documents to be stored in this mechanism.\n>\n>To this end, user agents should ensure that when deleting data, it is promptly deleted from the underlying storage.\n\nUnfortunately this plugin will not actually overwrite the deleted content unless the [secure_delete PRAGMA](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_secure_delete) is used.\n\n### SQL injection\n\nAs \"strongly recommended\" by [Web SQL Database API 8.5 SQL injection](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#sql-injection):\n>Authors are strongly recommended to make use of the `?` placeholder feature of the `executeSql()` method, and to never construct SQL statements on the fly.\n\n<!-- END Security -->\n\n# Avoiding data loss\n\n- Double-check that the application code follows the documented API for SQL statements, parameter values, success callbacks, and error callbacks.\n- For standard Web SQL transactions include a transaction error callback with the proper logic that indicates to the user if data cannot be stored for any reason. In case of individual SQL error handlers be sure to indicate to the user if there is any issue with storing data.\n- For single statement and batch transactions include an error callback with logic that indicates to the user if data cannot be stored for any reason.\n\n<!-- Avoiding data loss -->\n\n## Known issues\n\n- iOS/macOS platform version does not support certain rapidly repeated open-and-close or open-and-delete test scenarios due to how the implementation handles background processing\n- As described below, auto-vacuum is NOT enabled by default.\n- It is possible to request a SQL statement list such as \"SELECT 1; SELECT 2\" within a single SQL statement string, however the plugin will only execute the first statement and silently ignore the others ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#551](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/551)\n- INSERT statement that affects multiple rows (due to SELECT cause or using TRIGGER(s), for example) does not report proper rowsAffected on Android in case the built-in Android database used (using the `androidDatabaseImplementation` option in `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase`)\n- Infinity (positive or negative) values are not supported on Android/iOS/macOS due to issues described above including a possible crash on iOS/macOS ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#405](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/405)\n- A stability issue was reported on the iOS version when in use together with [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client such as [pusher-js](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js) at the same time (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#196](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/196)). The workaround is to call sqlite functions and [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client functions in separate ticks (using setTimeout with 0 timeout).\n- If a sql statement fails for which there is no error handler or the error handler does not return `false` to signal transaction recovery, the plugin fires the remaining sql callbacks before aborting the transaction.\n- FIXED in newer plugin versions such as [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage), [litehelpers / cordova-sqlite-ext](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-ext), [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free): In case of an error, the error `code` member is bogus on Android and Windows.\n- Possible crash on Android when using Unicode emoji and other 4-octet UTF-8 characters due to [Android bug 81341](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=81341), which *should* be fixed in Android 6.x\n- Close/delete database bugs described below.\n- When a database is opened and deleted without closing, the iOS/macOS platform version is known to leak resources.\n- It is NOT possible to open multiple databases with the same name but in different locations (iOS/macOS platform version).\n- Incorrect or missing insertId/rowsAffected in results for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE SQL statements with extra semicolon(s) in the beginning for Android (android.database implementation _using the androidDatabaseImplementation: 2 setting_)\n- Problems reported with PhoneGap Build in the past:\n  - PhoneGap Build Hydration.\n  - Apparently FIXED: ~~PhoneGap Build may fail to build the iOS version unless the name of the app starts with an uppercase and contains no spaces (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#243](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/243); [Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin#830](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/issues/830); [phonegap/build#431](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/431)).~~\n\nIssues fixed in some newer version branches:\n- In case of an error, the error `code` member is bogus on Android\n- iOS platform version generates extra logging in release version\n- iOS platform version may crash if deleteDatabase is called with an object in place of the database name\n- readTransaction does not reject ALTER, REINDEX, and REPLACE operations\n- readTransaction does not reject modification statements with extra semicolon(s) in the beginning\n- extra executeSql callbacks triggered in a transaction after a failure that was not recovered by an error callback that returns false\n- does not signal an error in case of excess parameter argument values given on iOS/macOS\n\n<!-- END Known issues -->\n\n## Other limitations\n\n- The db version, display name, and size parameter values are not supported and will be ignored.\n- Absolute and relative subdirectory path(s) are not tested or supported.\n- This plugin will not work before the callback for the 'deviceready' event has been fired, as described in **Usage**. (This is consistent with the other Cordova plugins.)\n- Extremely large records are not supported by this plugin version. TBD: specify maximum record; FUTURE TBD: to be fixed in [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free) (available with GPL or commercial license options)\n- This plugin version will not work within a web worker (not properly supported by the Cordova framework). Use within a web worker is supported for Android/iOS in: [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-workers-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-workers-free) (available with GPL or premium commercial license options)\n- In-memory database `db=window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: ':memory:', ...})` is currently not supported.\n- The Android version cannot work with more than 100 open db files (due to the threading model used).\n- UNICODE `\\u2028` (line separator) and `\\u2029` (paragraph separator) characters are currently not supported and known to be broken on Android version due to JSON issue reported in [cordova/cordova-discuss#57](https://github.com/cordova/cordova-discuss/issues/57) (workaround fix for iOS/macOS in this version branch). There *may* be a similar issue with certain other UNICODE characters on Android (needs further investigation).\n- _The BLOB data type_ is not fully supported on Windows. SELECT BLOB in Base64 format is supported by [litehelpers / cordova-sqlite-ext](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-ext) (permissive license terms) and [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free) (GPL or commercial license options).\n- Truncation in case of UNICODE `\\u0000` (same as `\\0`) character on Android (default Android-sqlite-connector database implementation) and Windows\n- Case-insensitive matching and other string manipulations on Unicode characters, which is provided by optional ICU integration in the sqlite source and working with recent versions of Android, is not supported for any target platforms.\n- iOS/macOS platform version uses a thread pool but with only one thread working at a time due to \"synchronized\" database access\n- Some large query results may be slow, also due to the JSON implementation.\n- UPDATE/DELETE with LIMIT or ORDER BY is not supported.\n- WITH clause is not supported by some older Android/iOS versions.\n- User-defined savepoints are not supported and not expected to be compatible with the transaction locking mechanism used by this plugin. In addition, the use of BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK statements is not supported.\n- Problems have been reported when using this plugin with Crosswalk (for Android). It may help to install Crosswalk as a plugin instead of using Crosswalk to create the project.\n- Does not work with [axemclion / react-native-cordova-plugin](https://github.com/axemclion/react-native-cordova-plugin) since the `window.sqlitePlugin` object is *not* properly exported (ES5 feature). It is recommended to use [andpor / react-native-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage) for SQLite database access with React Native Android/iOS instead.\n\n<!-- END Other limitations -->\n\n## Further testing needed\n\n- Integration with PhoneGap developer app\n- Use within [InAppBrowser](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/cordova_inappbrowser_inappbrowser.md.html)\n- Use within an iframe (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#368 (comment)](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/368#issuecomment-154046367))\n- Date/time handling\n- Maximum record size supported\n- Actual behavior when using SAVEPOINT(s)\n- R-Tree is not fully tested with Android\n- UNICODE characters not fully tested\n- Use with TRIGGER(s), JOIN and ORDER BY RANDOM\n- TODO add some *more* REGEXP tests\n- UPDATE/DELETE with LIMIT or ORDER BY (newer Android/iOS versions)\n- Integration with JXCore for Cordova (must be built without sqlite(3) built-in)\n- Delete an open database inside a statement or transaction callback.\n- WITH clause (not supported by some older sqlite3 versions)\n- Handling of invalid transaction and transaction.executeSql arguments\n- Use of database locations on macOS\n- Extremely large and small INTEGER and REAL values ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#627](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/627))\n- More emojis and other 4-octet UTF-8 characters\n- `?NNN`/`:AAA`/`@AAAA`/`$AAAA` parameter placeholders ref: <https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#varparam>, <https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/bind_blob.html>)\n- Single-statement and SQL batch transaction calls with invalid arguments (TBD behavior subject to change)\n\n<!-- END Further testing needed -->\n\n## Some tips and tricks\n\n- If you run into problems and your code follows the asynchronous HTML5/[Web SQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) transaction API, you can try opening a test database using `window.openDatabase` and see if you get the same problems.\n- In case your database schema may change, it is recommended to keep a table with one row and one column to keep track of your own schema version number. It is possible to add it later. The recommended schema update procedure is described below.\n\n<!-- END Some tips and tricks -->\n\n## Pitfalls\n\n### Some common pitfall(s)\n\n- If a database is opened using the standard `window.openDatabase` call it will not have any of the benefits of this plugin and features such as the `sqlBatch` call would not be available.\n- It is NOT allowed to execute sql statements on a transaction that has already finished, as described below. This is consistent with the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).\n- The plugin class name starts with \"SQL\" in capital letters, but in Javascript the `sqlitePlugin` object name starts with \"sql\" in small letters.\n- Attempting to open a database before receiving the 'deviceready' event callback.\n- Inserting STRING into ID field\n- Auto-vacuum is NOT enabled by default. It is recommended to periodically VACUUM the database.\n- Transactions on a database are run sequentially.

(Some known deviations are documented in newer version branches.)\n- Single-page application design is recommended.\n- In case of a multi-page application the JavaScript used by each page must use `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` to open the database access handle object before it can access the data.\n\n**NOTE:** If a sqlite statement in a transaction fails with an error, the error handler *must* return `false` in order to recover the transaction. This is correct according to the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) standard. This is different from the WebKit implementation of Web SQL in Android and iOS which recovers the transaction if a sql error hander returns a non-`true` value.\n\n## Opening a database\n\nThere are two options to open a database access object:\n- **Recommended:** `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'}, successcb, errorcb);`\n- **Classical:** `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase(\"myDatabase.db\", \"1.0\", \"Demo\", -1);`\n\nThe `location` option is used to specify the database subdirectory location (iOS/macOS *only*):\n- ~~`0`: `Documents` - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud~~ (disabled in this version)\n- ~~`1`: `Library` - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes~~ (disabled in this version)\n- `2` *(default)*: `Library/LocalDatabase` - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud (same as using \"default\")\n\n**WARNING:** The new \"default\" location value is *NOT* the same as the old default location _(in other version such as cordova-sqlite-storage and cordova-sqlite-ext)_ and would break an upgrade for an app that was using the old default value (0) on iOS.\n\n_NOT SUPPORTED by this version (TBD):_ ~~To specify a different location (affects iOS/macOS *only*):~~\n\n```js\nvar db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', iosDatabaseLocation: 'Library'}, successcb, errorcb);\n```\n\nwhere the `iosDatabaseLocation` option may be set to one of the following choices:\n- `default`: `Library/LocalDatabase` subdirectory - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud\n- ~~`Library`: `Library` subdirectory - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes~~ _(disabled in this version)_\n- ~~`Documents`: `Documents` subdirectory - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud~~ _(disabled in this version)_\n\n**WARNING:** Again, the new \"default\" iosDatabaseLocation value is *NOT* the same as the old default location _(in other version such as cordova-sqlite-storage and cordova-sqlite-ext)_ and would break an upgrade for an app using the old default value (0) on iOS.\n\n*ALTERNATIVE (deprecated):*\n- `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: \"my.db\", location: 2}, successcb, errorcb);`\n\nwith the `location` option set to one the following choices (affects iOS *only*):\n- ~~`0`~~ (default): `Documents` - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud~~ _(disabled in this version)_\n- ~~`1`: `Library` - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes~~ _(disabled in this version)_\n- `2`: `Library/LocalDatabase` - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud (same as using \"default\")\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the 'deviceready' event, as in the following example:\n\n```js\n// Wait for Cordova to load\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);\n\n// Cordova is ready\nfunction onDeviceReady() {\n  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'});\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe successcb and errorcb callback parameters are optional but can be extremely helpful in case anything goes wrong. For example:\n\n```js\nwindow.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'}, function(db) {\n  db.transaction(function(tx) {\n    // ...\n  }, function(err) {\n    console.log('Open database ERROR: ' + JSON.stringify(err));\n  });\n});\n```\n\nIf any sql statements or transactions are attempted on a database object before the openDatabase result is known, they will be queued and will be aborted in case the database cannot be opened.\n\n**DATABASE NAME NOTES:**\n\n- Database file names with slash (`/`) character(s) are not supported and not expected to work.\n- Database file names with ASCII control characters such as tab, vertical tab, carriage return, line feed, form feed, and backspace are not supported and do not work on Windows.\n- Some other ASCII characters not supported and not working on Windows: `*` `<` `>` `?` `\\` `\"` `|`\n- Database file names with emojis and other 4-octet UTF-8 characters are NOT RECOMMENDED.\n\n**OTHER NOTES:**\n- The database file name should include the extension, if desired.\n- It is possible to open multiple database access handle objects for the same database.\n- The database handle access object can be closed as described below.\n\n**Web SQL replacement tip:**\n\nTo overwrite `window.openDatabase`:\n\n```Javascript\nwindow.openDatabase = function(dbname, ignored1, ignored2, ignored3) {\n  return window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: dbname, location: 'default'});\n};\n```\n\n### Pre-populated database(s)\n\nPut the database file in the `www` directory and open the database like:\n\n```js\nvar db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: \"my.db\", createFromLocation: 1});\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- Put the pre-populated database file in the `www` subdirectory.\n- The pre-populated database file name must match **exactly** the file name given in `openDatabase`. This plugin does *not* use an automatic extension.\n- The pre-populated database file is ignored if the database file with the same name already exists in the database file location.\n\n**TIP:** If you don't see the data from the pre-populated database file, completely remove your app and try it again!\n\n**Alternative:** You can also use [an-rahulpandey / cordova-plugin-dbcopy](https://github.com/an-rahulpandey/cordova-plugin-dbcopy) to install a pre-populated database\n\n**Samples and tutorials:**\n- http://redwanhilali.com/ionic-sqlite/\n- Example by [@jdnichollsc](https://github.com/jdnichollsc) using Ionic Framework, ngCordova and promises: https://gist.github.com/jdnichollsc/9ac79aaa3407e92677ba\n- Tutorial using *alternative solution at [an-rahulpandey / cordova-plugin-dbcopy](https://github.com/an-rahulpandey/cordova-plugin-dbcopy)* (Android/iOS): https://blog.nraboy.com/2015/01/deploy-ionic-framework-app-pre-filled-sqlite-db/\n- https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-pre-populated-db-example-android (based on Cordova 2.7)\n\n### Android sqlite implementation\n\nBy default, this plugin uses [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector), which is lightweight and should be more efficient than the built-in Android database classes. To use the built-in Android database classes instead:\n\n```js\nvar db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: \"my.db\", androidDatabaseImplementation: 2});\n```\n\n**NOTE:** The internal memory improvements do *not* apply to the use of the built-in Android database classes.\n\n### Workaround for Android db locking issue\n\n[litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#193](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/193) was reported (as observed by several app developers) that on some newer versions of the Android database classes, if the app is stopped or aborted without closing the database then:\n- (sometimes) there is an unexpected database lock\n- the data that was inserted is lost.\n\nThe cause of this issue remains unknown. Of interest: [android / platform_external_sqlite commit d4f30d0d15](https://github.com/android/platform_external_sqlite/commit/d4f30d0d1544f8967ee5763c4a1680cb0553039f) which references and includes the sqlite commit at: http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/6c4c2b7dba\n\nThere is an optional workaround that simply closes and reopens the database file at the end of every transaction that is committed. The workaround is enabled by opening the database with options as follows:\n\n```js\nvar db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({\n  name: 'my.db',\n  location: 'default',\n  androidDatabaseImplementation: 2,\n  androidLockWorkaround: 1\n});\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This workaround is *only* applied when using `db.sqlBatch` or `db.transaction()`, *not* applied when running `executeSql()` on the database object.\n\n<!-- END Workaround for Android db locking issue -->\n\n## SQL transactions\n\nThe following types of SQL transactions are supported by this version:\n- Single-statement transactions\n- SQL batch transactions\n- Standard asynchronous transactions\n- Multi-part transactions\n\n**NOTE:** Transaction requests are kept in one queue per database and executed in sequential order, according to the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).\n\n**WARNING:** It is possible to request a SQL statement list such as \"SELECT 1; SELECT 2\" within a single SQL statement string, however the plugin will only execute the first statement and silently ignore the others. This could result in data loss if such a SQL statement list with any INSERT or UPDATE statement(s) are included. For reference: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#551](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/551)\n\n### Single-statement transactions\n\nSample with INSERT:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.executeSql('INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?)', ['test-value'], function (resultSet) {\n  console.log('resultSet.insertId: ' + resultSet.insertId);\n  console.log('resultSet.rowsAffected: ' + resultSet.rowsAffected);\n}, function(error) {\n  console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);\n});\n```\n\nSample with SELECT:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.executeSql(\"SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength\", [], function (resultSet) {\n  console.log('got stringlength: ' + resultSet.rows.item(0).stringlength);\n}, function(error) {\n  console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);\n});\n```\n\n**NOTE/minor bug:** The object returned by `resultSet.rows.item(rowNumber)` is **not** immutable. In addition, multiple calls to `resultSet.rows.item(rowNumber)` with the same `rowNumber` on the same `resultSet` object return the same object. For example, the following code will show `Second uppertext result: ANOTHER`:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.executeSql(\"SELECT UPPER('First') AS uppertext\", [], function (resultSet) {\n  var obj1 = resultSet.rows.item(0);\n  obj1.uppertext = 'ANOTHER';\n  console.log('Second uppertext result: ' + resultSet.rows.item(0).uppertext);\n  console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);\n});\n```\n\n<!-- END Single-statement transactions -->\n\n### SQL batch transactions\n\nSample:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.sqlBatch([\n  'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MyTable',\n  'CREATE TABLE MyTable (SampleColumn)',\n  [ 'INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?)', ['test-value'] ],\n], function() {\n  db.executeSql('SELECT * FROM MyTable', [], function (resultSet) {\n    console.log('Sample column value: ' + resultSet.rows.item(0).SampleColumn);\n  });\n}, function(error) {\n  console.log('Populate table error: ' + error.message);\n});\n```\n\nIn case of an error, all changes in a sql batch are automatically discarded using ROLLBACK.\n\n<!-- END SQL batch transactions -->\n\n### Standard asynchronous transactions\n\nStandard asynchronous transactions follow the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) which is very well documented and uses BEGIN and COMMIT or ROLLBACK to keep the transactions failure-safe. Here is a simple example:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.transaction(function(tx) {\n  tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MyTable');\n  tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE MyTable (SampleColumn)');\n  tx.executeSql('INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?)', ['test-value'], function(tx, resultSet) {\n    console.log('resultSet.insertId: ' + resultSet.insertId);\n    console.log('resultSet.rowsAffected: ' + resultSet.rowsAffected);\n  }, function(tx, error) {\n    console.log('INSERT error: ' + error.message);\n  });\n}, function(error) {\n  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);\n}, function() {\n  console.log('transaction ok');\n});\n```\n\nIn case of a read-only transaction, it is possible to use `readTransaction` which will not use BEGIN, COMMIT, or ROLLBACK:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.readTransaction(function(tx) {\n  tx.executeSql(\"SELECT UPPER('Some US-ASCII text') AS uppertext\", [], function(tx, resultSet) {\n    console.log(\"resultSet.rows.item(0).uppertext: \" + resultSet.rows.item(0).uppertext);\n  }, function(tx, error) {\n    console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);\n  });\n}, function(error) {\n  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);\n}, function() {\n  console.log('transaction ok');\n});\n```\n\n**WARNING:** It is NOT allowed to execute sql statements on a transaction after it has finished. Here is an example from the **Populating Cordova SQLite storage with the JQuery API post** at <http://www.brodybits.com/cordova/sqlite/api/jquery/2015/10/26/populating-cordova-sqlite-storage-with-the-jquery-api.html>:\n\n```Javascript\n  // BROKEN SAMPLE:\n  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: \"test.db\"});\n  db.executeSql(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tt\");\n  db.executeSql(\"CREATE TABLE tt (data)\");\n\n  db.transaction(function(tx) {\n    $.ajax({\n      url: 'https://api.github.com/users/litehelpers/repos',\n      dataType: 'json',\n      success: function(res) {\n        console.log('Got AJAX response: ' + JSON.stringify(res));\n        $.each(res, function(i, item) {\n          console.log('REPO NAME: ' + item.name);\n          tx.executeSql(\"INSERT INTO tt values (?)\", JSON.stringify(item.name));\n        });\n      }\n    });\n  }, function(e) {\n    console.log('Transaction error: ' + e.message);\n  }, function() {\n    // Check results:\n    db.executeSql('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tt', [], function(res) {\n      console.log('Check SELECT result: ' + JSON.stringify(res.rows.item(0)));\n    });\n  });\n```\n\nYou can find more details and a step-by-step description how to do this right in the **Populating Cordova SQLite storage with the JQuery API** post at: <http://www.brodybits.com/cordova/sqlite/api/jquery/2015/10/26/populating-cordova-sqlite-storage-with-the-jquery-api.html>\n\n**NOTE/minor bug:** Just like the single-statement transaction described above, the object returned by `resultSet.rows.item(rowNumber)` is **not** immutable. In addition, multiple calls to `resultSet.rows.item(rowNumber)` with the same `rowNumber` on the same `resultSet` object return the same object. For example, the following code will show `Second uppertext result: ANOTHER`:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.readTransaction(function(tx) {\n  tx.executeSql(\"SELECT UPPER('First') AS uppertext\", [], function(tx, resultSet) {\n    var obj1 = resultSet.rows.item(0);\n    obj1.uppertext = 'ANOTHER';\n    console.log('Second uppertext result: ' + resultSet.rows.item(0).uppertext);\n    console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**FUTURE TBD:** It should be possible to get a row result object using `resultSet.rows[rowNumber]`, also in case of a single-statement transaction. This is non-standard but is supported by the Chrome desktop browser.\n\n### Multi-part transactions\n\nSample (with success and error callbacks):\n\n```Javascript\nvar tx = db.beginTransaction();\ntx.executeSql(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable\");\ntx.executeSql(\"CREATE TABLE mytable (myfield)\");\n\ntx.executeSql(\"INSERT INTO mytable values(?)\", ['test value']);\ntx.executeSql(\"SELECT * from mytable\", [], function(tx, res) {\n  console.log(\"Got value: \" + res.rows.item(0).myfield);\n}, function(tx, e) {\n  console.log(\"Ignore unexpected error callback with message: \" + e.message);\n  return false;\n});\n\ntx.end(function() {\n  console.log('Optional success callback fired');\n}, function(e) {\n  console.log(\"Optional error callback fired with message: \" + e.message);\n});\n```\n\nSample with abort:\n\n```Javascript\nvar tx = db.beginTransaction();\ntx.executeSql(\"INSERT INTO mytable values(?)\", ['wrong data']);\ntx.abort(function() {\n  console.log('Optional callback');\n});\n```\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- In case a `tx.executeSql` call results in an error and it does not have an error callback or the error callback does NOT return `false`, the transaction will be aborted *immediately* with a ROLLBACK ~~upon the `tx.end` call~~.\n- **BUG:** If a `tx.executeSql` call results in an error for which there is no error callback, the error callback does NOT return `false`, or the error callback throws an exception, the transaction is silently aborted and no `tx.end` callbacks will be fired.\n- When a multi-part transaction is started by the `db.beginTransaction` call, all other transactions are blocked until the multi-part transaction is either completed successfully or aborted (with a ROLLBACK).\n\n<!-- END Multi-part transactions -->\n\n## Background processing\n\nThe threading model depends on which version is used:\n- For Android, one background thread per db;\n- for iOS/macOS, background processing using a very limited thread pool (only one thread working at a time);\n- for Windows, no background processing (for future consideration).\n\n<!-- END Background processing -->\n\n## Sample with PRAGMA feature\n\nCreates a table, adds a single entry, then queries the count to check if the item was inserted as expected. Note that a new transaction is created in the middle of the first callback.\n\n```js\n// Wait for Cordova to load\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);\n\n// Cordova is ready\nfunction onDeviceReady() {\n  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'});\n\n  db.transaction(function(tx) {\n    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');\n    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');\n\n    // demonstrate PRAGMA:\n    db.executeSql(\"pragma table_info (test_table);\", [], function(res) {\n      console.log(\"PRAGMA res: \" + JSON.stringify(res));\n    });\n\n    tx.executeSql(\"INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)\", [\"test\", 100], function(tx, res) {\n      console.log(\"insertId: \" + res.insertId + \" -- probably 1\");\n      console.log(\"rowsAffected: \" + res.rowsAffected + \" -- should be 1\");\n\n      db.transaction(function(tx) {\n        tx.executeSql(\"select count(id) as cnt from test_table;\", [], function(tx, res) {\n          console.log(\"res.rows.length: \" + res.rows.length + \" -- should be 1\");\n          console.log(\"res.rows.item(0).cnt: \" + res.rows.item(0).cnt + \" -- should be 1\");\n        });\n      });\n\n    }, function(e) {\n      console.log(\"ERROR: \" + e.message);\n    });\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**NOTE:** PRAGMA statements must be executed in `executeSql()` on the database object (i.e. `db.executeSql()`) and NOT within a transaction.\n\n<!-- END Sample with PRAGMA feature -->\n\n## Sample with transaction-level nesting\n\nIn this case, the same transaction in the first executeSql() callback is being reused to run executeSql() again.\n\n```js\n// Wait for Cordova to load\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);\n\n// Cordova is ready\nfunction onDeviceReady() {\n  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'});\n\n  db.transaction(function(tx) {\n    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');\n    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');\n\n    tx.executeSql(\"INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)\", [\"test\", 100], function(tx, res) {\n      console.log(\"insertId: \" + res.insertId + \" -- probably 1\");\n      console.log(\"rowsAffected: \" + res.rowsAffected + \" -- should be 1\");\n\n      tx.executeSql(\"select count(id) as cnt from test_table;\", [], function(tx, res) {\n        console.log(\"res.rows.length: \" + res.rows.length + \" -- should be 1\");\n        console.log(\"res.rows.item(0).cnt: \" + res.rows.item(0).cnt + \" -- should be 1\");\n      });\n\n    }, function(tx, e) {\n      console.log(\"ERROR: \" + e.message);\n    });\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThis case will also works with Safari (WebKit), assuming you replace `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` with `window.openDatabase`.\n\n<!-- END Sample with transaction-level nesting -->\n\n## Attach to another database\n\nTo attach to another database in the default location:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.attach('alias_name', 'dbfilename', optionalSuccessCallback, optionalErrorCallback);\n```\n\n**NOTE:** For Android the database *must* be opened with the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` option (FUTURE TBD).\n\n### Detach\n\n```Javascript\ndb.detach('alias_name', optionalSuccessCallback, optionalErrorCallback);\n```\n\n### To list attached databases\n\n```Javascript\ndb.executeSql('PRAGMA database_list', [], function(res) {\n  console.log('alias: ' + res.rows.item(1).name);\n  console.log('file: ' + res.rows.item(1).file);\n});\n```\n\nFor more information: http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_database_list\n\n## Close a database object\n\nThis will invalidate **all** handle access handle objects for the database that is closed:\n\n```js\ndb.close(successcb, errorcb);\n```\n\nIt is OK to close the database within a transaction callback but *NOT* within a statement callback. The following example is OK:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.transaction(function(tx) {\n  tx.executeSql(\"SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength\", [], function(tx, res) {\n    console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);\n  });\n}, function(error) {\n  // OK to close here:\n  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);\n  db.close();\n}, function() {\n  // OK to close here:\n  console.log('transaction ok');\n  db.close(function() {\n    console.log('database is closed ok');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThe following example is NOT OK:\n\n```Javascript\n// BROKEN:\ndb.transaction(function(tx) {\n  tx.executeSql(\"SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength\", [], function(tx, res) {\n    console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);\n    // BROKEN - this will trigger the error callback:\n    db.close(function() {\n      console.log('database is closed ok');\n    }, function(error) {\n      console.log('ERROR closing database');\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**BUG:** It is currently NOT possible to close a database in a `db.executeSql` callback. For example:\n\n```Javascript\n// BROKEN DUE TO BUG:\ndb.executeSql(\"SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength\", [], function (res) {\n  var stringlength = res.rows.item(0).stringlength;\n  console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);\n\n  // BROKEN - this will trigger the error callback DUE TO BUG:\n  db.close(function() {\n    console.log('database is closed ok');\n  }, function(error) {\n    console.log('ERROR closing database');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**SECOND BUG:** When a database connection is closed, any queued transactions are left hanging. All pending transactions should be errored when a database connection is closed.\n\n**NOTE:** As described above, if multiple database access handle objects are opened for the same database and one database handle access object is closed, the database is no longer available for the other database handle objects. Possible workarounds:\n- It is still possible to open one or more new database handle objects on a database that has been closed.\n- It *should* be OK not to explicitly close a database handle since database transactions are [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) compliant and the app's memory resources are cleaned up by the system upon termination.\n\n**FUTURE TBD:** `dispose` method on the database access handle object, such that a database is closed once **all** access handle objects are disposed.\n\n<!-- END Close a database object -->\n\n## Delete a database\n\n```js\nwindow.sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'}, successcb, errorcb);\n```\n\nwith `location` or `iosDatabaseLocation` parameter *required* as described above for `openDatabase` (affects iOS/macOS *only*)\n\nAlternative supported by this version:\n\n```js\nwindow.sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase(name: 'my.db', successcb, errorcb);\n```\n\n**BUG:** When a database is deleted, any queued transactions for that database are left hanging. TODO: All pending transactions should be errored when a database is deleted.\n\n<!-- END Delete a database -->\n\n## Database schema versions\n\nThe transactional nature of the API makes it relatively straightforward to manage a database schema that may be upgraded over time (adding new columns or new tables, for example). Here is the recommended procedure to follow upon app startup:\n- Check your database schema version number (you can use `db.executeSql` since it should be a very simple query)\n- If your database needs to be upgraded, do the following *within a single transaction* to be failure-safe:\n  - Create your database schema version table (single row single column) if it does not exist (you can check the `sqlite_master` table as described at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1601151/how-do-i-check-in-sqlite-whether-a-table-exists)\n  - Add any missing columns and tables, and apply any other changes necessary\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Since we cannot be certain when the users will actually update their apps, old schema versions will have to be supported for a very long time.\n\n<!-- END Database schema versions -->\n\n## Use with Ionic/ngCordova/Angular\n\n### Ionic 2\n\nTutorials with Ionic 2:\n- <https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/08/using-sqlstorage-instead-sqlite-ionic-2-app/> (title is somewhat misleading, \"SQL storage\" *does* use this sqlite plugin)\n- <https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/12/use-sqlite-in-ionic-2-instead-of-local-storage/> (older tutorial)\n\nSample for Ionic 2 wanted ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#585](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/585)\n\n### Ionic 1\n\nTutorial with Ionic 1: <https://blog.nraboy.com/2014/11/use-sqlite-instead-local-storage-ionic-framework/>\n\nA sample for Ionic 1 is provided at: [litehelpers / Ionic-sqlite-database-example](https://github.com/litehelpers/Ionic-sqlite-database-example)\n\nDocumentation at: <http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/sqlite/>\n\nOther resource (apparently for Ionic 1): <https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/how-use-sqlite-ionic-store-data>\n\n**NOTE:** Some Ionic and other Angular pitfalls are described above.\n\n<!-- END Use with Ionic/ngCordova/Angular -->\n\n# Installing\n\n## Easy install with Cordova CLI tool\n\n    npm install -g cordova # (in case you don't have cordova)\n    cordova create MyProjectFolder com.my.project MyProject && cd MyProjectFolder # if you are just starting\n    cordova plugin add https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free\n \n**IMPORTANT:** sometimes you have to update the version for a platform before you can build, like: `cordova prepare ios`\n\n**CLI NOTES:**\n\n- You *may* have to update the platform and plugin version(s) before you can build: `cordova prepare` (or for a specific platform such as iOS: `cordova prepare ios`)\n- If you cannot build for a platform after `cordova prepare`, you may have to remove the platform and add it again, such as:\n\n```shell\ncordova platform rm ios\ncordova platform add ios\n```\n\nor more drastically:\n\n```shell\nrm -rf platforms\ncordova platform add ios\n```\n\n<!-- END Easy installation with Cordova CLI tool -->\n\n## Plugin installation sources\n\n- https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free - latest version\n\n<!-- END Plugin installation sources -->\n\n## Source tree\n\n- `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md`: platform-independent (Literate coffee-script, can be read by recent coffee-script compiler)\n- `www`: `SQLitePlugin.js` platform-independent Javascript as generated from `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md` (and checked in!)\n- `src`: platform-specific source code\n- `spec`: test suite using Jasmine (2.2.0)\n- `tests`: very simple Jasmine test suite that is run on Circle CI (Android version) and Travis CI (iOS version) (used as a placeholder)\n\n## Installation test\n\n### Easy installation test\n\nUse `window.sqlitePlugin.echoTest` and/or `window.sqlitePlugin.selfTest` as described above (please wait for the `deviceready` event).\n\n### Quick installation test\n\nAssuming your app has a recent template as used by the Cordova create script, add the following code to the `onDeviceReady` function, after `app.receivedEvent('deviceready');`:\n\n```Javascript\n  window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({ name: 'hello-world.db', location: 'default' }, function (db) {\n    db.executeSql(\"select length('tenletters') as stringlength\", [], function (res) {\n      var stringlength = res.rows.item(0).stringlength;\n      console.log('got stringlength: ' + stringlength);\n      document.getElementById('deviceready').querySelector('.received').innerHTML = 'stringlength: ' + stringlength;\n   });\n  });\n```\n\n<!-- END Installation test -->\n\n# Support\n\n## Policy\n\nFree support is provided on a best-effort basis and is only available in public forums.
